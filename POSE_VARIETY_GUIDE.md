While the agent randomly varies poses, you can influence the vibe:

**Want more professional?**
- Use phrases: "professional team photo", "corporate style", "business photo"

**Want more fun?**
- Use phrases: "excited team photo", "celebration photo", "fun team shot"

**Want balanced?**
- Use phrases: "team photo", "co-founder photo" (default balanced mix)

## 📊 Statistics

Based on the implementation:

- **2-3 people**: 50-70% chance of mixed poses
- **4+ people**: 50/50 mix target with random distribution
- **Pose repetition**: Avoided within same photo
- **Natural grouping**: Maintained for all sizes

## 🎯 The Goal

Create photos that say:

> "We're professional founders building something serious, but we're also real people who are excited and passionate about what we do."

This is the essence of YC culture - ambitious yet down-to-earth. The pose variety captures exactly that!
