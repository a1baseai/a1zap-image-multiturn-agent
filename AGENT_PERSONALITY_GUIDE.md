# Agent Personality Guide

## Quick Overview

Your agent's personality is defined in JavaScript configuration files in the `agents/` directory.

**Files to edit:**
- `agents/brandoneats-agent.js` - Brandon Eats restaurant data agent
- `agents/claude-docubot-agent.js` - Generic document reference agent

---

## How to Change Personality

Open the agent file and edit the `systemPrompt`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: 'Your Agent Name',
  
  // üé≠ EDIT THIS - Define personality and behavior
  systemPrompt: `You are a helpful assistant focused on analyzing data.
  
Your capabilities:
- Analyze CSV data and provide insights
- Answer questions based on uploaded files
- Provide clear, accurate information

Communication style:
- Professional yet friendly
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Include specific data when available`,
  
  // ‚öôÔ∏è Control response style
  generationOptions: {
    temperature: 0.7,    // 0.0 = factual, 1.0 = creative
    maxTokens: 4096      // Maximum response length
  }
};
```

---

## Temperature Settings

The `temperature` parameter controls creativity vs. consistency:

```javascript
// Very factual and consistent - best for data analysis
temperature: 0.2

// Balanced - works well for most cases (default)
temperature: 0.7

// Creative and varied - best for marketing/content
temperature: 0.9
```

## Best Practices

### Be Specific
‚úÖ Good:
```javascript
systemPrompt: `You are a restaurant data analyst. Always reference specific data points from the CSV. When asked about restaurants, provide name, rating, and location.`
```

‚ùå Vague:
```javascript
systemPrompt: `You help with data.`
```

### Set Boundaries
‚úÖ Good:
```javascript
systemPrompt: `...
If asked about information not in the uploaded file, clearly state: "I don't have that information in the current dataset."

Never make up or guess data - only use what's actually present.`
```

### Define Communication Style
‚úÖ Good:
```javascript
systemPrompt: `...
Communication style:
- Professional but approachable
- Use emojis sparingly (only for emphasis)
- Keep responses under 3 paragraphs unless analysis requires more
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items`
```

### Include Examples
‚úÖ Good:
```javascript
systemPrompt: `...
Example questions you can answer:
- "What are the top-rated restaurants?"
- "Show me restaurants with delivery"
- "What's the average price range?"

Example responses should be formatted like:
**Top Rated Restaurants:**
1. Restaurant Name - 4.8‚òÖ (Location)
2. Another Place - 4.7‚òÖ (Location)`
```

## After Making Changes

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. **Test with a sample query** in A1Zap or via curl

Changes take effect immediately on restart.

## Creating a New Agent

Want a completely custom agent?

1. **Copy an existing agent file:**
```bash
cp agents/brandoneats-agent.js agents/my-custom-agent.js
```

2. **Edit the new file** with your personality and settings

3. **Create a webhook handler** (copy `webhooks/brandoneats-webhook.js`):
```javascript
const myCustomAgent = require('../agents/my-custom-agent');

// In the handler, use:
response = await claudeService.chatWithBaseFile(conversation, {
  systemPrompt: myCustomAgent.systemPrompt,
  ...myCustomAgent.generationOptions
});
```

4. **Register the webhook** in `server.js`:
```javascript
app.post('/webhook/mycustom', require('./webhooks/my-custom-webhook'));
```

5. **Set the webhook URL** in A1Zap to `https://your-server.com/webhook/mycustom`

---

## Tips

1. **Test incrementally** - Make small changes and test to see the effect
2. **Use clear instructions** - The clearer your prompt, the better the results
3. **Set explicit boundaries** - Tell the agent what NOT to do
4. **Define the format** - Show examples of how responses should look
5. **Match temperature to use case** - Lower for facts, higher for creativity
