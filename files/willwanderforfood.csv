The Happy Crane,https://www.tiktok.com/@willwanderforfood/video/7563448724924534030,"This place is already the most hyped new Chinese spot in SF. I had to come back to try their special Peking duck experience.

The skin is everything, and here, it’s extra thick and crispy. They even pair it with pluots, which was unexpected but great in the wraps.

The rest of the modern menu hits hard as well. I love the firecracker shrimp and salted egg yolk squash. And their cocktails are excellent.

Safe to say, I left as happy as a crane.

This time it was literally the worst human being I personally know. They parked themselves right in front of me for half of Dom Dolla’s set, and pretended not to see me. Thank goodness they eventually skied away.

I knew I should have just kept my ass in VIP dancing and eating. Farmhouse Thai always has a sweet setup with a main stage view.

I enjoyed this wagyu burger stacked with pork belly and fried egg. And I had clear line of sight to Bob Moses.

The cocktails came with Pokémon cards. I poured mine into a coconut to take on the dance floor.

Next year, I’m posted up at VIP. Views, spicy eats, and no basic Team Rocket run-ins.

The hummus? Smooth and creamy. The pita? Extra fluffy.Of course I got all the dips, like this spiced amba aioli, tangy green s’chug, and crispy fried cauliflower bites to dunk it all in.

They’ve got locations throughout California, and their newest in Burlingame opens this fall.

The Happy Crane is SF’s hottest new opening. Scoring a table feels like winning Taylor Swift tickets. That could make anyone feral.

It’s modern dim sum. Start off with bites like firecracker shrimp and golden coin with coppa and chicken liver mousse.

Then escalate to perfectly chewy biang biang noodles, juicy iberico pork jowl, and whole quail.

Dessert was peak emotions. I nearly cried over the mango sago sorbet, and the decadent hazelnut-chocolate mochi finished me.
And the Black Dragon cocktail? This fiery dragon baby was obsessed. Then Taiwanese baijiu shots showed up out of nowhere. Unhinged? Or maybe we just know how to have a good time.

And they just launched a separate Peking duck experience. Reservations drop daily at noon, first come first serve. I already snagged mine…but I might resell for the right buyer. Okay, maybe I’m a little unstable.
