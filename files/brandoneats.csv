Saigon Central Post Office,Experience,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7326398793815969031,"Then we went to be a typical tourist at the post office.
I swear this is on every itinerary.
Not surprised
it was packed with tourists.
But if you take that away,
it feels like I was transported back in time.
Picked up my favorite letter
and sent it back home to my parents.

Ho Thi Ky Night Market,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7204394863167606017,"Everything I ate for $5
at the  at Ho Thi Ky Night Market in saigon
This market is a hidden local gem
that has over hundred stores.
And one of them is this lady
that was sloshing away with this squid and oil.
So I had to try it.
And it's covered with cumin,
which is so delectable.
Then I saw this uncle that didn't have any customers,
but his school is really good
and they were tasted like smoky beef jerky.
Next I found my favorite Viet dessert,
avocado ice cream.
This coconut ice cream slathered with avocado puree.
And the weather was really hot,
but this was freezing cold.
Then I had some takiyyaki,
which is surprisingly decent.
And this really caught my eye.
Looks like takoyaki
but it's actually quail egg
with toppings like seaweed and meat.
It's really crispy at the bottom
and the Kewpie Mayo
chilli sauce combo made it the perfect street snack.
We were really thirsty
and we found my cousin's favourite place
for peach iced tea,
which was so refreshing and full of peachy flavour.
And finally I had bun caulk
mini savory pancakes topped with meat,
prawns and egg.
It was really crispy
but a bit too dry and oily here.",yes
Pizza 4Ps,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7344679237082762504,"Is pizza and pasta in Vietnam a waste or is it great?
Normally I avoid anything that's not Viet food,
but I needed to reset my palette.
So let's start with the burrata
that was mixed with fruit.
Sounds strange,
but the sweet and creamy combo works,
at least for a few bites.
Next, the signature crab pasta had an intense
creamy krabby flavor like a bisque.
The pasta was nice and al dente.
Finally, the pizza.
Impressed to see wood fired
because it's not real pizza without that smoky flavor.
The four cheese drizzled with honey was delicious.
And the Margarita was just decent.
It's obviously not as good as Naples or even Sydney,
but overall, pretty great.",yes

I got the bun meter.
Com. This is the small one.
This is 38 k, $2.
Let's give it a go.
Hmm. The base, so crispy and light.
The patay is really turm flavorful.
They put the right amount of cold meat,
pork, rice and pickled veggies.
It's just a really well balanced bun meat.
Better than hoonhuang, like nearby.",yes
Com Tam Ba Ghien,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7275310178642300161,"Today I missed a flight,
but it's alright because I got to try this famous
Michelin Guide com tam spot in saigong.
So let's see if it's worth the hype.
I ordered the special 9 dollar plate
which had everything.
It's pretty expensive for Vietnam standards,
but the portion was massive.
Pork chop was nice and smoky,
but to be on the sweet side,
this shredded pork skin beef just hit the spot.
It came with a few other meats like this meatloaf,
which is so nice and soft.
It also had this sausage and meatball,
but these were kind of redundant and cold.
I recommend just getting the plate with a pork chop,
egg and meatloaf.
But honestly,
you can go to a random com tam spot on the street
and it'll probably be just as good.",yes
Secret Garden District Saigon,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7274913856378490113,"I just found a hidden rooftop restaurant in saigon
You literally have to climb out eight flights of stairs
in a random apartment complex.
But once you see the city skyline,
it's all worth it.
They serve home style dishes,
which I won't lie to you,
I'm gonna be the best food you get in the city,
but it's not that watered down.
Even my local Viet cousins approved.
The really good dishes were this mango and fish salad,
this grilled egg plain with scallion oil
and the deep fried anchovies.
It's full of tourists,
so it's on the more expensive side,
around 8 to 13 AUD per dish.
But I think the overall experience makes it worth it,
especially if you are tourist.",yes
Cuc Gach Restaurant,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7176013846396636417,"guys, I've just found my new favourite restaurant
in Saigon District 1.
and it's caught Cuc Gach,
which means brick in English.
and I think that's because they serve homestyle meals,
which really reminded me of my mom's cooking.
holy. this is the best cooked supper crab I've had.
I think I ordered 10 dishes and everything was top tier.
probably don't like this. dude.
the dishes were around 100 250 K each,
which is around like 6 to $8 each.
I mean, just look at my reaction to this salad.
I can't recommend this place enough

you know, out of the street.

for a world balanced royal feast,
especially these spring rolls in the meat stuffed tofu,
which I stuffed up.
so can't forget the infamous

but is it worth the hype?
of course! we had to get the Obama set
and this comes with bun cha ,
beer and a seafood spring roll for $5.
considering the Obama name tag
is pretty reasonably priced.
basically how you ate this.
you dunked the noodles in the sauce
and then ate some of the meat and the veggies.
this bun cha  was perfect.
the meat had a strong smoky flavor and the fish sauce
soup was the perfect tangy compliment.
the spring roll was the best I've had.

this place has been doing it for over 60 years
and it's already packed at 6am with all the locals.
I got the Pho Tai Nam and this was 3.
the broth is light,
beefy, gingery, and it's good for breakfast,
but doesn't really compare with southern pho,
which has more depth and spice flavor.
also, what makes northern Pho special
is you get these Chinese donuts.
I'm not really a big fan of it.

the classic beef pho, which originated in the north.
You know, the very first time I tried a Hanoi pho,
I was really underwhelmed cause I'm so used to the southern one,
which is more sweet and spiceful.
But this spot just made me appreciate northern fur as its own thing.
Oh, that's really good. Wow.
They're super beefy, fragrant from the ginger.

on the regular. And I'm so mad.
It's an eight hour flight away.
This spot is on the Michelin Guide,
which low key made me think it was gonna be a tourist trap,
but it was actually full of locals.
There's literally one granny grilling away.
She side eyeing me, but don't worry,
ask for permission. And that turns into this massive bucket of meat.
The aunties at the front prepare your spread
and serve it in this metal tray.
Can you believe this was $3?
So the meat is super smoky
and that fish sauce was an Olympic punch of flavor.
This deserves a gold medal.
And the crab spring rolls were that good that I had to go for seconds.
Also, some people say that hanoi's are really cold,

Let's see if I'll make it.
We're at the Michelin Guide spot to see if it's actually good.
It's like they know I have a flight to catch
cause this took like 30 seconds.
So I got the rare beef and brisket bowl
and this was 70 k for kangaroo dollars.
That might sound cheap,
but it's actually on the more expensive side here.
But hey, it's a touristy spot. Still.
The flour is solid. Nice beefy soup,
good quality meat, slippery noodles.

so it's officially closed,

so we tried going in one way, but
there was this police officer that was blocking the way,
so he walked around.
and then there was this dude that LED us in.
and I was expecting to get scared,
but the drinks are actually fairly priced.
the trains come around every hour
and I was lucky enough to see 2.
but warting they're pretty loud.
and these cafes actually only operate on days
when there are no police patrols.
and feel really bad for these cafe owners because,
well, as essentially their livelihood is now kneecapped.

they make their food straight out of their family home,

it's located in the mountains of Nimbin,
and we walked in the dark to get here.
you see, in an outdoor area in the backyard,
and it feels just like a family gathering.
there's no menu,
but they can cater to whatever you want to eat.
just kept coming out with more and more food,
and I was so full I couldn't breathe.
and every dish was immaculate or 10 out of 10.
but the highlight was definitely this sea
snail stir fry.
all of this cost only 8 dollars per person,
and that's insanely cheap because we got so much.
and for dessert,
the owner offered us some of his homemade alcohol.
he also joined us.
I had no idea what was in this.
so when you need to recover,
there's also hammocks that you can lie in.
recommend calling them in advance

the best part is it's a whole hot Spring Park.
There's even a water park section,
which is a good place to start cause it's probably gonna be so hot.
Hopefully you don't get stuck like us.
We had to wiggle around for a solid 5 minutes
before we actually got through.
And all the wiggly around made us so hungry
we had to get a little snack.
And they even do onsen eggs here
cooked by the natural hot spring water.
You gotta get it with these Viet instant noodles.
But I swear the last time I had this in,
oh, it was hard boiled.
So I was not expecting it to droop out like this when I was opening it.
Now walk past this curl spot Simpson,

Honestly, at first it was really underwhelming.

And that's saying something
because I went all the way to where
where it was invented.
As soon as I walked in,
I was surprised at how nice the place looked
since I was expecting my
friend to take me somewhere on the street.
But this is the owner
and she told me she lets her broth simmer overnight
to extract all that good flavour from the bones.
The prices here are higher for Vietnam standards,
but she sources really high quality ingredients
like this ox tongue.
I got the special bowl with everything. So. Alright,

1 thing you need to try when you're here.
Actually never had mi quang before coming to Vietnam,

Definitely better than FR.
It's a noodle dish
that's halfway between a soup and a dry one,
because they put just enough broth to cover the noodles,
so it's more concentrated.
Kind of like dipping ramen.
They topple with egg,
chicken, prawn,
and veggies.

Put some veggies on.
You got your slab of pork belly.
You roll it up nicely like this.
You dip it in this shrimp paste.
This is really strong.
Just dip a little bit.
Be afraid of this sauce. Any remedy?
Brought over this dish of different kinds of bun.
I recommend getting this
so you can try a bit of everything.
I thought we were done,
but then he brought this bun gan gu.
And the flavours were kind of lacking
compared to the ones in my hometown.
And finally we tried these BA LA Lot skewers.
And they were good. Best grab driver, he wanted us to try all the local specialties in Da Nang and even paid for everything, so idk how much anything costed but it should be cheap since its in the market. don’t worry we tipped very well!!

It came with this bonus egg that was inside the quail.
Then I saw this lady selling some fresh
Vietnamese donut.
I love this.
It's soft, chewy, and a little bit sweet.

avocado ice cream.
Oh, what's this?
Oh, man, this was one of the best things I've ever eaten.
I'm pairing with the bun tiao I got before.
I'm a genius.
Even better with this.

5 stars honestly doesn't mean much in Vietnam,
but these rooms actually feel pretty luxe.
I think it helps that it's newly built,
just opened last year. And the cool thing about this hotel
is that every room has a view of the beach.
So I booked the partial view,

Imagine waking up to this.
It will be insane.
And thank god the beds are actually soft like western style,
not like a typical rock hard Vietnamese bed.
And the buffet breakfast is not bad either.
Good mix of western and Viet food.
There's also access to a pool and a gym.

Saigon Central Post Office,Experience,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7326398793815969031,"Then we went to be a typical tourist at the post office.
I swear this is on every itinerary.
Not surprised
it was packed with tourists.
But if you take that away,
it feels like I was transported back in time.
Picked up my favorite letter
and sent it back home to my parents.

And we can't go inside cause right now
I think the service on Saturdays and Sundays,
but it's outside that matters, not inside.

Ho Thi Ky Night Market,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7204394863167606017,"Everything I ate for $5
at the  at Ho Thi Ky Night Market in saigon
This market is a hidden local gem
that has over hundred stores.
And one of them is this lady
that was sloshing away with this squid and oil.
So I had to try it.
And it's covered with cumin,
which is so delectable.
Then I saw this uncle that didn't have any customers,
but his school is really good
and they were tasted like smoky beef jerky.
Next I found my favorite Viet dessert,
avocado ice cream.
This coconut ice cream slathered with avocado puree.
And the weather was really hot,
but this was freezing cold.
Then I had some takiyyaki,
which is surprisingly decent.
And this really caught my eye.
Looks like takoyaki
but it's actually quail egg
with toppings like seaweed and meat.
It's really crispy at the bottom
and the Kewpie Mayo
chilli sauce combo made it the perfect street snack.
We were really thirsty
and we found my cousin's favourite place
for peach iced tea,
which was so refreshing and full of peachy flavour.
And finally I had bun caulk
mini savory pancakes topped with meat,
prawns and egg.
It was really crispy
but a bit too dry and oily here.",
Pizza 4Ps,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7344679237082762504,"Is pizza and pasta in Vietnam a waste or is it great?
Normally I avoid anything that's not Viet food,
but I needed to reset my palette.
So let's start with the burrata
that was mixed with fruit.
Sounds strange,
but the sweet and creamy combo works,
at least for a few bites.
Next, the signature crab pasta had an intense
creamy krabby flavor like a bisque.
The pasta was nice and al dente.
Finally, the pizza.
Impressed to see wood fired
because it's not real pizza without that smoky flavor.
The four cheese drizzled with honey was delicious.
And the Margarita was just decent.
It's obviously not as good as Naples or even Sydney,
but overall, pretty great.",
Bánh Mì Hồng Hoa,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7315026196121570561,"Finally, find a banh mi in Vietnam
that's on par with the ones in Sydney.
I got the bun meter.
Com. This is the small one.
This is 38 k, $2.
Let's give it a go.
Hmm. The base, so crispy and light.
The patay is really turm flavorful.
They put the right amount of cold meat,
pork, rice and pickled veggies.
It's just a really well balanced bun meat.
Better than hoonhuang, like nearby.",
Com Tam Ba Ghien,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7275310178642300161,"Today I missed a flight,
but it's alright because I got to try this famous
Michelin Guide com tam spot in saigong.
So let's see if it's worth the hype.
I ordered the special 9 dollar plate
which had everything.
It's pretty expensive for Vietnam standards,
but the portion was massive.
Pork chop was nice and smoky,
but to be on the sweet side,
this shredded pork skin beef just hit the spot.
It came with a few other meats like this meatloaf,
which is so nice and soft.
It also had this sausage and meatball,
but these were kind of redundant and cold.
I recommend just getting the plate with a pork chop,
egg and meatloaf.
But honestly,
you can go to a random com tam spot on the street
and it'll probably be just as good.",
Secret Garden District Saigon,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7274913856378490113,"I just found a hidden rooftop restaurant in saigon
You literally have to climb out eight flights of stairs
in a random apartment complex.
But once you see the city skyline,
it's all worth it.
They serve home style dishes,
which I won't lie to you,
I'm gonna be the best food you get in the city,
but it's not that watered down.
Even my local Viet cousins approved.
The really good dishes were this mango and fish salad,
this grilled egg plain with scallion oil
and the deep fried anchovies.
It's full of tourists,
so it's on the more expensive side,
around 8 to 13 AUD per dish.
But I think the overall experience makes it worth it,
especially if you are tourist.",
Cuc Gach Restaurant,Eat,Saigon,https://www.tiktok.com/@brandneweats/video/7176013846396636417,"guys, I've just found my new favourite restaurant
in Saigon District 1.
and it's caught Cuc Gach,
which means brick in English.
and I think that's because they serve homestyle meals,
which really reminded me of my mom's cooking.
holy. this is the best cooked supper crab I've had.
I think I ordered 10 dishes and everything was top tier.
probably don't like this. dude.
the dishes were around 100 250 K each,
which is around like 6 to $8 each.
I mean, just look at my reaction to this salad.
I can't recommend this place enough
if you're looking for more upscale,
you know, out of the street.
this is a 10 out of 10",
