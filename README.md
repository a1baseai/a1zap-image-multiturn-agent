# AI Agent System with File Context 🤖📁

Multi-model AI agent system with file-aware capabilities, powered by **Claude** and **Gemini**. Create intelligent agents that analyze documents, CSV data, and provide context-aware responses through A1Zap webhooks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Keys

**Claude API Key** (Required):
- Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Create an account and get your API key
- Required for file operations and document analysis

**A1Zap Credentials** (Required):
- Go to A1Zap app → Make → Agent API
- Create your agent → Copy your API Key and Agent ID

**Gemini API Key** (Optional):
- Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- Provides additional model flexibility

### 2. Deploy

#### Option A: Replit (Recommended)

1. Import this project to Replit
2. Add to Secrets (🔒 in sidebar):
```
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_key
A1ZAP_API_KEY=your_a1zap_key
A1ZAP_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
BASE_URL=https://your-repl.repl.co
```
3. Click **Run**

#### Option B: Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file:
```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_key
A1ZAP_API_KEY=your_a1zap_key
A1ZAP_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Upload a File

Upload a document for your agent to reference:

```bash
# Upload a file
npm run upload /path/to/your/file.csv

# Or use the sample
npm run upload files/brandoneats.csv
```

### 4. Configure A1Zap Webhook

In A1Zap app → Select your agent → Set webhook URL:
- For generic file operations: `https://your-server.com/webhook/claude`
- For Brandon Eats data: `https://your-server.com/webhook/brandoneats`

### 5. Test It! 🎉

Start chatting with your agent - it will use uploaded files as context!

## 🎭 Customize Agent Personality

Edit the system prompt in your agent configuration file to change how your agent behaves:

```javascript
// agents/brandoneats-agent.js or agents/claude-docubot-agent.js
module.exports = {
  name: 'Your Agent Name',
  
  // 👇 EDIT THIS to customize personality, tone, and behavior
  systemPrompt: `You are a helpful assistant...
  
  Your capabilities:
  - Analyze data and provide insights
  - Answer questions based on uploaded files
  - Be friendly and professional
  
  Communication style:
  - Clear and concise
  - Use examples when helpful`,
  
  generationOptions: {
    temperature: 0.7,  // 0.0 = factual, 1.0 = creative
    maxTokens: 4096    // Response length
  }
};
```

**📖 See `AGENT_PERSONALITY_GUIDE.md` for detailed examples and instructions.**

## 📁 File Management

### Upload Files

```bash
# Upload and set as base file (used for all responses)
npm run upload /path/to/document.pdf
```

Or use the API:
```javascript
const { uploadFileToClaude } = require('./services/file-upload');

const result = await uploadFileToClaude('./document.pdf', {
  setAsBase: true
});
```

### Check Files

```bash
# Check current base file
curl http://localhost:3000/files/base

# List all uploaded files
curl http://localhost:3000/files/list
```

### Supported File Types
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Text files (`.txt`)
- CSV (`.csv`)
- JSON (`.json`)
- Markdown (`.md`)
- HTML (`.html`)
- XML (`.xml`)

## 🎯 Two Specialized Agents

### 1. Generic File Agent (`/webhook/claude`)
General-purpose document-aware agent:
- Answer questions about uploaded documents
- Analyze PDFs, text files, CSV data
- Context-aware responses based on file content

**Agent Config:** `agents/claude-docubot-agent.js`

### 2. Brandon Eats Data Analyst (`/webhook/brandoneats`)
Specialized for restaurant/food data:
- CSV data parsing and analysis
- **Intelligent filtering system** - only sends relevant responses and social links
- **Alternative suggestions** - suggests related content when exact matches aren't available
- Social media link extraction (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- Rich content responses with embedded media
- Custom prompts for food industry queries

**Agent Config:** `agents/brandoneats-agent.js`  
**📖 See `INTELLIGENT_FILTERING.md` for details on the smart triage and filtering system.**  
**📖 See `ALTERNATIVE_SUGGESTIONS.md` for details on contextual alternative suggestions.**

## 🎨 Rich Content Support

The Brandon Eats agent supports rich content:

### Social Media Embeds
Send social media posts with automatic embedding:

```javascript
const richContentBlocks = [
  {
    type: 'social_share',
    data: {
      platform: 'instagram',
      url: 'https://www.instagram.com/reel/...'
    },
    order: 0
  },
  {
    type: 'social_share',
    data: {
      platform: 'tiktok',
      url: 'https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/...'
    },
    order: 1
  }
];

await brandonEatsClient.sendMessage(chatId, 'Check out these videos!', richContentBlocks);
```

**📖 See `RICH_CONTENT_GUIDE.md` for more rich content types.**

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Intelligent Filtering & Social Link Extraction

The Brandon Eats agent uses a sophisticated multi-stage filtering system:

1. **Off-Topic Triage**: Filters out irrelevant questions (weather, sports, etc.) before processing
2. **Smart Social Links**: Only sends TikTok videos when specific restaurants are discussed
3. **Alternative Suggestions**: When exact matches aren't available, suggests relevant alternatives with context

```javascript
// User: "I want restaurants over $100"
// Bot: "Brandon doesn't cover high-end dining, he focuses on street food..."
// Follow-up: "💡 These are Brandon's most elevated dining experiences..."
//            [Sends 2-3 TikTok links with context]
```

**Benefits:**
- Saves API costs by avoiding unnecessary processing
- Users only get relevant social media links
- **Even "not found" responses now provide helpful alternatives**
- Clear boundaries about bot's purpose
- Assumes user intent for food/travel questions

### Conversation History

Both agents maintain conversation context:
- Last 10 messages are retrieved automatically
- User names are included for multi-user chats
- History is passed to Claude for contextual responses

### Message Deduplication

Built-in duplicate message detection prevents double-processing:
- 5-minute deduplication window
- Automatic cleanup of old entries
- Race condition protection
