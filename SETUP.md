# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
1. **Claude API Key** - Get from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **A1Zap Credentials** - Get from A1Zap app â†’ Make â†’ Agent API
3. **Gemini API Key** (Optional) - Get from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

---

## Step 1: Get Claude API Key

1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to API Keys â†’ Create Key
4. Copy your key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

---

## Step 2: Get A1Zap Credentials

1. Open A1Zap app
2. Go to **Make** â†’ **Agent API**
3. Create a new agent or select existing
4. Copy both:
   - **API Key**
   - **Agent ID**

---

## Step 3: Configure Environment

### Option A: Replit (Recommended for hosting)

1. Import project to Replit
2. Click ðŸ”’ **Secrets** in sidebar
3. Add these secrets:

```
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
A1ZAP_API_KEY=your-a1zap-key
A1ZAP_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id
BASE_URL=https://your-repl-name.repl.co
```

4. Click **Run**

### Option B: Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file in project root:
```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
A1ZAP_API_KEY=your-a1zap-key
A1ZAP_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

---

## Step 4: Upload a File

Your agent needs a file to reference. Upload one:

```bash
# Upload your own file
npm run upload /path/to/your/file.csv

# Or use the included sample
npm run upload files/brandoneats.csv
```

You should see:
```
âœ… File uploaded successfully!
ðŸ“„ File ID: file_abc123xyz
ðŸ“Š Filename: brandoneats.csv
âœ“ Set as base file
```

---

## Step 5: Configure A1Zap Webhook

1. Open A1Zap app
2. Go to your agent settings
3. Find **Webhook URL** field
4. Enter your webhook URL:

**For generic file operations:**
```
https://your-server.com/webhook/claude
```

**For Brandon Eats data analysis:**
```
https://your-server.com/webhook/brandoneats
```

5. Save the settings

---

## Step 6: Test Your Agent

### Test in A1Zap
1. Open a chat with your agent
2. Send a message asking about the uploaded file
3. Agent should respond with information from the file!

### Test Locally
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/claude \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chat": {"id": "test-123"},
    "message": {"content": "What data do you have?"},
    "agent": {"id": "agent-123"}
  }'
```

---

## Verify Setup

Check all configurations:
```bash
npm run check
```

Expected output:
```
=== Configuration Status ===
âœ… Claude API: Configured
âœ… A1Zap API: Configured
âœ… A1Zap Agent: Configured
âœ… Base File: brandoneats.csv (file_abc123)
âœ… Server URL: https://your-server.com
```

---

## Common Issues

### "Claude API key not configured"
**Solution:** Set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in environment variables or `.env` file

### "No base file set"
**Solution:** Upload a file with `npm run upload /path/to/file.csv`

### "Webhook not responding"
**Solution:** 
- Check server is running: `npm start`
- Verify webhook URL in A1Zap matches your server URL
- Check server logs for errors

### "Agent doesn't use file context"
**Solution:**
- Verify base file is set: `curl http://localhost:3000/files/base`
- Make sure you're using the correct webhook endpoint (`/webhook/claude` or `/webhook/brandoneats`)

---

## Next Steps

âœ… Setup complete! Now you can:

1. **Customize Personality** - Edit `agents/brandoneats-agent.js` or `agents/claude-docubot-agent.js`
2. **Upload More Files** - Use `npm run upload` to add documents
3. **Use Rich Content** - See `RICH_CONTENT_GUIDE.md` for social embeds
4. **Deploy to Production** - Use Replit, Heroku, or your preferred host

## Architecture Overview

```
User Message (A1Zap)
    â†“
Webhook Handler (your server)
    â†“
Load Agent Config (personality, settings)
    â†“
Fetch Conversation History
    â†“
Claude API (with uploaded file)
    â†“
Generate Response
    â†“
Send Response (A1Zap)
```

**The file is attached to your server's webhook endpoint, not to individual A1Zap agents. Any agent using your webhook will have access to the uploaded file.**
