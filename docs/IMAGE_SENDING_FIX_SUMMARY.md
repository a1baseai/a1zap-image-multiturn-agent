# Image Sending to A1Zap - Fix Summary

## Problem
Images generated by the Makeup Artist agent were not being sent back to the chat via A1Zap.

## Investigation Results

‚úÖ **Configuration is correct**:
- BASE_URL is properly set to `https://a1base-demo-1.ngrok.app`
- Server is running and accessible
- Images can be served from the ngrok URL
- A1Zap API credentials are configured
- Message format matches A1Zap API requirements

‚úÖ **Code is correct**:
- `a1zapClient.sendMediaMessage()` is implemented correctly
- Webhook calls it properly
- Payload format matches the reference implementation

## What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced Logging in `a1zap-client.js`

Added detailed logging to track API requests:
- Full URL being called
- Complete payload being sent
- Response status and data
- Detailed error information

### 2. Enhanced Logging in `makeup-artist-webhook.js`

Added detailed logging before sending:
- Chat ID being used
- Test mode status
- Image URL being sent
- Message content
- API response details

### 3. Diagnostic Test Scripts

Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test-image-url-generation.js` - Verify BASE_URL configuration
- `test-send-image.js` - Test image saving and URL generation
- `verify-ngrok-access.js` - Verify ngrok accessibility
- `test-full-webhook-flow.js` - Simulate complete webhook flow

## Message Format (Confirmed Correct) ‚úÖ

```json
{
  "chatId": "chat_id_here",
  "content": "Your message text",
  "media": {
    "url": "https://your-public-url.com/temp-images/filename.png",
    "contentType": "image/png"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "gemini-webhook-agent",
    "messageType": "image"
  }
}
```

This is sent to:
```
POST https://api.a1zap.com/v1/messages/individual/{AGENT_ID}/send
Headers:
  X-API-Key: <your_api_key>
  Content-Type: application/json
```

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Restart your server** to enable enhanced logging:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Send a test image** through the makeup artist webhook

3. **Check server logs** for:
   - `üì∏ Image saved and available at:` - Image was generated
   - `üöÄ Sending media message to A1Zap API...` - API call is being made
   - `‚úÖ Media message sent to A1Zap` - API call succeeded
   - Full payload and response details

4. **Look for errors**:
   - If you see `‚ö†Ô∏è Test mode: Skipping A1Zap send`, check if chat ID starts with "test-"
   - If you see API errors, check the detailed error log for status code and message

## Test Mode Note

The code has a test mode check:
```javascript
if (chatId && chatId.startsWith('test-')) {
  // Skip sending to A1Zap
}
```

If your chat ID starts with `"test-"`, messages won't be sent to A1Zap. This is by design for testing.

## What to Share if Still Not Working

After testing with the enhanced logging, if images still don't appear, share:

1. The relevant server logs showing:
   - The generated image URL
   - The API request details
   - The API response or error

2. The chat ID you're testing with (to confirm it's not in test mode)

3. Any error messages from the A1Zap API response

## Example of What You Should See in Logs

When working correctly, you should see:

```
üì∏ Image saved and available at: https://a1base-demo-1.ngrok.app/temp-images/makeup_XXX.png
Preparing to send image message...
  Chat ID: <actual_chat_id>
  Test mode: false
  Image URL: https://a1base-demo-1.ngrok.app/temp-images/makeup_XXX.png
  Message text: Here's your makeup transformation...
üöÄ Sending media message to A1Zap API...
üì§ A1Zap API Request Details:
   URL: https://api.a1zap.com/v1/messages/individual/<agent_id>/send
   Chat ID: <chat_id>
   Media URL: https://a1base-demo-1.ngrok.app/temp-images/makeup_XXX.png
   Content length: 123 chars
   Payload: {
     "chatId": "...",
     "content": "...",
     "media": {
       "url": "https://...",
       "contentType": "image/png"
     }
   }
‚úÖ Media message sent to A1Zap: {...}
   Status: 200 OK
```

If you see this, the image is being sent successfully! ‚úÖ
