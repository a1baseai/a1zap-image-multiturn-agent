# Recent Changes Summary

## Makeup Artist Agent - Context Handling Fix (October 26, 2025)

### Issue Fixed
The makeup artist agent was not using conversation history when generating images, causing it to ignore previous makeup requests when users uploaded images later in the conversation.

### Files Modified

1. **agents/makeup-artist-agent.js**
   - Enhanced `buildPrompt()` function to analyze conversation history
   - Extracts makeup-related keywords from recent messages
   - Builds context from last 6 messages
   - Handles empty/minimal messages by using previous context

2. **webhooks/makeup-artist-webhook.js**
   - Updated to pass conversation history to `buildPrompt()`
   - Added logging to show generated prompts for debugging

### Files Added

1. **tests/test-makeup-context.js**
   - Comprehensive test suite for multi-turn context handling
   - Tests prompt building logic
   - Simulates real conversation flows

2. **MAKEUP_CONTEXT_FIX.md**
   - Detailed documentation of the problem and solution
   - Technical details and examples
   - Testing instructions

### How It Works Now

**Before the fix:**
```
User: Can you give me full glam
Agent: [responds with text]
User: [sends image]
Agent: [generates image without "full glam" - context ignored!]
```

**After the fix:**
```
User: Can you give me full glam
Agent: [responds with text describing the look]
User: [sends image]
Agent: [generates image WITH "full glam" applied from context!]
```

### Benefits

- ✅ Natural multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Users can discuss before uploading images
- ✅ Context preserved across messages
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ More accurate image generation

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm start &
sleep 5
node tests/test-makeup-context.js
```

### Migration Notes

No breaking changes. The fix is backward compatible and automatically improves existing deployments.
