# Image Context Tracking Fix

## Problem

The makeup artist agent wasn't tracking previous images and makeup requests, causing issues like:

1. User: "Apply it to this image too" â†’ Agent asks what makeup to apply (ignoring previous style)
2. User: "Yes" (confirming a change) â†’ Agent asks them to upload an image (ignoring context)
3. User shares multiple images in sequence â†’ Agent doesn't remember earlier images

## Root Cause Analysis

The conversation history was being tracked, but:

1. **Images weren't included in history** - `processMessageHistory` only tracked text content, completely ignoring `media` fields
2. **Previous makeup requests weren't extracted** - No logic to identify what makeup style was requested before
3. **Reference phrases weren't detected** - Phrases like "apply it", "same style", "this image too" weren't recognized
4. **No fallback to recent images** - When user says "Yes" without an image, the system didn't look for recent images

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `webhook-helpers.js`

Added three new helper functions:

#### `processMessageHistory` (Enhanced)
```javascript
processMessageHistory(messageHistory, agentId, includeImages = false)
```
- New parameter: `includeImages` - when `true`, tracks `imageUrl` from `msg.media.url`
- Now captures image-only messages (user sends image without text)
- Backward compatible (defaults to `false` for other agents)

#### `findRecentImage` (New)
```javascript
findRecentImage(conversation, lookbackLimit = 5)
```
- Searches backward through conversation history for user-uploaded images
- Returns the most recent image URL within the lookback limit
- Useful when user says "Yes" or similar without attaching a new image

#### `extractPreviousMakeupRequest` (New)
```javascript
extractPreviousMakeupRequest(conversation, lookbackLimit = 10)
```
- Finds the most recent substantive makeup request from the user
- Filters out trivial messages like "yes", "ok" 
- Looks for makeup-related keywords (lipstick, eye, glam, blue, slim, etc.)
- Returns the full text of the previous request

### 2. Updated `makeup-artist-webhook.js`

Enhanced the webhook handler to:

1. **Fetch history with images enabled**:
   ```javascript
   const conversation = await webhookHelpers.fetchAndProcessHistory(
     a1zapClient, chatId, agentId, 20, true  // true = include images
   );
   ```

2. **Fallback to recent images**:
   ```javascript
   let effectiveImageUrl = imageUrl;
   if (!effectiveImageUrl) {
     effectiveImageUrl = webhookHelpers.findRecentImage(conversation, 5);
   }
   ```

3. **Extract previous context**:
   ```javascript
   const previousRequest = webhookHelpers.extractPreviousMakeupRequest(conversation, 10);
   ```

4. **Smart prompt building**:
   - If user sends text without image but there's a recent image and previous request
   - Use the previous request as the makeup style to apply

### 3. Enhanced `makeup-artist-agent.js` Prompt Building

Updated `buildPrompt` function to:

1. **Detect reference phrases**:
   - "apply it"
   - "same"
   - "this image too"
   - "do the same"
   - "like before"
   - "yes" (when there's a previous makeup request)

2. **Use previous makeup style when appropriate**:
   ```javascript
   if ((!hasSubstantialMessage || isReferencingPrevious) && previousMakeupStyle) {
     return `Apply this makeup style: ${previousMakeupStyle}
     
     Keep your text response brief and friendly - describe what you've done in 1-2 sentences.`;
   }
   ```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the image context tracking test:
```bash
node tests/test-image-context-tracking.js
```

Expected results:
- âœ… Find recent image from history
- âœ… Extract previous makeup request
- âœ… Build prompt referencing previous style
- âœ… Process history with image URLs
- âœ… Handle "Yes" with context

### Integration Test

To verify if the A1Zap API actually returns media fields in message history:

```bash
node tests/test-history-media-field.js <REAL_CHAT_ID>
```

Replace `<REAL_CHAT_ID>` with an actual chat ID from a makeup artist conversation.

**This test will reveal:**
- âœ… If media fields are included in the API response
- âœ… What the media field structure looks like
- âœ… If our image tracking logic works end-to-end

### Manual Testing

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Send an image with makeup request: "Natural makeup with pink lipstick"
3. Agent should apply makeup and respond
4. Send another image with: "Apply it to this image too"
5. **Expected**: Agent applies the same "natural makeup with pink lipstick" style
6. Send a new request: "Make the lips blue"
7. Agent confirms: "Would you like me to proceed?"
8. Reply: "Yes"
9. **Expected**: Agent applies blue lips to the most recent image

## Potential Issues

### Issue: API May Not Return Media in History

Many chat APIs don't include media attachments in history endpoints for performance reasons.

**If `test-history-media-field.js` shows NO media fields:**

This is a **backend limitation** and requires a different solution:

#### Option A: Local Image Cache
Store recent images in memory with chat context:
```javascript
const imageCache = new Map(); // chatId -> [recent images]
```

#### Option B: Session-Based Tracking
Track images per chat session in Redis or a database

#### Option C: Request API Enhancement
Contact A1Zap team to request media inclusion in history endpoint

#### Option D: Parse from Content
If images are referenced in message content (e.g., `"[Image: url]"`), parse them

### Issue: Memory Limitations

If tracking images for many chats, we'll need to:
- Implement cache expiration (TTL)
- Limit number of images stored per chat
- Consider persistent storage for longer conversations

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `/services/webhook-helpers.js` - Added image tracking helpers
- `/webhooks/makeup-artist-webhook.js` - Integrated image context tracking
- `/agents/makeup-artist-agent.js` - Enhanced prompt building

### Created
- `/tests/test-image-context-tracking.js` - Unit tests
- `/tests/test-history-media-field.js` - Integration test
- `/tests/debug-message-history.js` - Debug utility
- `/IMAGE_CONTEXT_TRACKING_FIX.md` - This document

## Next Steps

1. **Run the integration test** with a real chat ID:
   ```bash
   node tests/test-history-media-field.js <CHAT_ID>
   ```

2. **If media is NOT in history**: Implement image caching solution (Option A above)

3. **If media IS in history**: Test the full flow manually to verify everything works

4. **Deploy and monitor**: Watch for logs showing "ðŸ“¸ Found recent image" and "ðŸ’„ Found previous makeup request"

## Success Criteria

The fix is working when:

âœ… User says "Apply it to this image too" â†’ Agent uses previous makeup style  
âœ… User says "Yes" after a makeup request â†’ Agent applies to recent image  
âœ… User shares multiple images â†’ Agent can reference earlier ones  
âœ… No more "What kind of makeup would you like?" when context is clear  
âœ… Logs show image tracking: `ðŸ“¸ Found recent image from N messages ago`  
âœ… Logs show context tracking: `ðŸ’„ Found previous makeup request: "..."`
