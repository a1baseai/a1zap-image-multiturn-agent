# Yash the YC Photographer Agent

## Overview

The YC Photographer agent is an AI-powered image editing agent that places people in iconic Y Combinator settings. Built using the same architecture as the Makeup Artist agent, it leverages Gemini's image generation capabilities to transform photos.

## Features

### Two Signature Styles

1. **YC Sign Photo** (Default)
   - Places subjects in front of the iconic Y Combinator office sign
   - Outdoor entrance setting with natural lighting
   - Professional but approachable atmosphere
   
2. **Orange Background Studio**
   - Places subjects in front of the famous YC orange background wall
   - Features distinctive acoustic foam panels
   - Clean studio setup with professional lighting

### Automatic Style Detection

The agent automatically detects which style you want based on keywords in your message:

**YC Sign Keywords:** "sign", "entrance", "door", "outside", "outdoor"
**Orange Background Keywords:** "orange", "background", "wall", "foam", "panel", "studio", "indoor"

If no specific keywords are detected, it defaults to the YC sign style.

### Multi-Turn Conversations

- Supports iterative editing across conversation turns
- Tracks previous style requests
- Recognizes "same style" and "this one too" requests
- Maintains conversation context even when A1Zap history is unavailable

### Multiple People Support

- **Group Photos**: Automatically detects and includes ALL people in the image
- **Natural Poses**: Each person gets a unique pose with variety
- **Mix of Styles**: Combines professional poses (arms crossed, confident stance) with fun poses (peace signs, thumbs up, pointing at sign)
- **Authentic Energy**: Captures the excitement and camaraderie of startup teams
- **Works for**: Co-founders, full teams, pairs, or solo portraits

## Usage Examples

User: [sends another photo] Same style
Yash: üì∏ Another great shot with the orange background!
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# YC Photographer Agent (Yash)
YC_PHOTOGRAPHER_API_KEY=your_yc_photographer_api_key_here
YC_PHOTOGRAPHER_AGENT_ID=your_yc_photographer_agent_id_here
YC_PHOTOGRAPHER_API_URL=https://api.a1zap.com/v1/messages/individual

# Optional: Send reference images before edited photos
YC_SEND_REFERENCE_IMAGES=true
```

If not specified, the agent will fall back to the default `A1ZAP_API_KEY`.

### Reference Images Feature (Optional)

The agent can send a reference image showing the YC setting **before** sending the edited photo. This helps users understand what they're getting.

**To enable:**
1. Set `YC_SEND_REFERENCE_IMAGES=true` in your `.env`
2. Place reference images in the `reference-images/` directory:
   - `yc-sign-reference.jpg` - Photo of YC sign entrance
   - `yc-orange-reference.jpg` - Photo of YC orange background

**Example flow:**
```
User: [sends photo] "Can I get the orange background?"

Agent: üì∏ Here's what the YC Orange Background looks like! I'll place you in this setting.
       [sends reference image]
       
Agent: Here you go! Looking fantastic in front of the YC orange wall! üß°
       [sends edited photo]
```

See `reference-images/README.md` for detailed setup instructions.
