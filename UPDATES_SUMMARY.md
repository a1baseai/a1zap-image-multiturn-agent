# YC Photographer Agent - Recent Updates Summary

## 🎉 What's New

Two major enhancements have been added to the YC Photographer agent:

### 1. ✅ Reference Images Feature
**Send example images before edited photos**

### 2. ✅ Multi-Person & Pose Variety
**Handle group photos with natural, varied poses**

---

## 📸 Feature 1: Reference Images

### What It Does
Sends a reference image showing the YC setting (sign or orange background) **before** generating and sending the edited photo.

### Why It's Useful
- Sets clear expectations for users
- Shows them exactly what setting they'll be placed in
- Professional onboarding experience
- Helps users understand the two different styles

### How to Enable

**Step 1:** Add to `.env`:
```bash
YC_SEND_REFERENCE_IMAGES=true
```

**Step 2:** Add reference images to `reference-images/`:
- `yc-sign-reference.jpg`
- `yc-orange-reference.jpg`

**Step 3:** Restart server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Example Flow
```
User: [sends photo] "Put me in front of the YC sign"
   ↓
Agent: 📸 Here's what the YC Sign Entrance looks like! I'll place you in this setting.
       [sends yc-sign-reference.jpg]
   ↓
(500ms delay)
   ↓
Agent: 📸 Here's your YC photo! Looking great in front of the sign!
       [sends edited photo]

### What It Does
- **Detects multiple people** in images automatically

- **Natural arrangement**: People positioned naturally in front of YC settings

### Why It's Useful

**Fun/Casual Poses** (50%):

### How It Works

**Automatic!** No setup required - just send group photos:

```
User: [sends photo with 3 co-founders] "YC sign please!"

Agent: 📸 Love the team energy! Here's your founding team in front of the YC sign!
       [All 3 people appear with varied poses - mix of professional and fun]
```
