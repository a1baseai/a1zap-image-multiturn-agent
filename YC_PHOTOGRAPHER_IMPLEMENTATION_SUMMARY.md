- Mirrors makeup artist agent structure
- Uses shared services (`geminiService`, `imageStorage`, `conversationCache`, `webhookHelpers`)
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Test mode support for development

## Next Steps

The agent is ready for production use! To get started:

1. Set environment variables
2. Configure A1Zap webhook
