# ‚ö° Smart Social Links - Quick Start

## What Is It?

Your BrandyEats bot now **automatically sends TikTok videos** when it mentions restaurants from your CSV file!

## How to Test (30 seconds)

### Option 1: WhatsApp (Easiest)
```
1. Open WhatsApp
2. Message your BrandyEats bot: "Tell me about Rau M√° Mix"
3. Watch for TWO messages:
   - First: Text response from Claude
   - Second: TikTok video embed (automatic!)
```

### Option 2: Test Script
```bash
node test-social-links.js
```

### Option 3: Specific Query Test
Try asking about restaurants in the CSV:
- "Where should I eat in Saigon?"
- "Tell me about Ocean Palace"
- "What's Rau M√° Mix like?"

---

## What You'll See

**Message 1 (Text):**
```
Based on the data, Rau M√° Mix is a unique spot in Saigon with a matcha-like 
Vietnamese drink that's really good!
```

**Message 2 (Auto - Rich Content):**
```
üé• Here's a video about Rau M√° Mix!
[Embedded TikTok video player]
```

---

## How It Works

1. User asks question
2. Bot analyzes CSV and responds with text
3. **NEW:** Bot re-reads its own response
4. **NEW:** Claude AI identifies which restaurants were mentioned
5. **NEW:** Bot automatically sends TikTok videos as follow-up

4. Check console logs for errors

**Wrong videos appearing?**
1. Verify restaurant names in CSV
2. Check console for Claude's detection results
3. Test with: `node test-social-links.js extract`

## Try These Queries

Ask your bot:
- "What's good to eat in Saigon?"
- "Tell me about Rau M√° Mix"
- "Where is Ocean Palace?"
- "What should I try at Ho Thi Ky Night Market?"

Each should trigger automatic TikTok videos! üé•
