# Complete Image Context Tracking Fix

## Problem Statement

The makeup artist agent was failing to process images properly. The issues were:

### Issue 1: No Image Generated by Gemini
- User sends an image → Gemini returns text-only (no edited image)
- Root cause: **Empty/vague prompts** sent to Gemini

### Issue 2: Lost Context Between Messages  
- User: "Make my skin lighter and my brows sharper" (text only)
- User: *sends image* 
- Expected: Apply the previous makeup request to the new image
- Actual: Agent asks "What would you like?" (lost context)

### Issue 3: Unreliable History API
- First message: History API works ✅
- Second message: History API returns 500 error ❌
- Without history, no context about previous images or requests

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Message History API Failures**: A1Zap's `/v1/messages/individual/{agentId}/chat/{chatId}` endpoint intermittently returns 500 errors
2. **Empty Prompts to Gemini**: When user sends just an image with no text, and history is unavailable, Gemini gets a vague prompt
3. **No Fallback Mechanism**: System had no way to recover from API failures

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Conversation Cache Service (`services/conversation-cache.js`)

Created an in-memory cache that stores:
- **Recent images** (last 5 per chat)
- **Recent makeup requests** (last 10 per chat)
- **Auto-expiry** (30 minutes of inactivity)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Filters out trivial messages ("yes", "ok", "[Image]")
- ✅ Per-chat isolation (Chat A doesn't see Chat B's data)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired chats
- ✅ Works independently of API health

### 2. Enhanced Webhook Logic (`webhooks/makeup-artist-webhook.js`)

**New Flow:**
1. **Cache incoming content first** (before API calls)
2. **Try history API** (but don't fail if it's down)
3. **Fall back to cache** if API fails
4. **Build context** from cache + history combined

**Three-Tier Image Lookup:**
```javascript
1. Current message imageUrl    // Direct attachment
2. Recent image from history    // API-provided context
3. Recent image from cache      // Fallback when API fails
```

**Three-Tier Request Lookup:**
```javascript
1. Extract from conversation history
2. Fall back to cached request
3. Use default "natural makeup look" prompt
```

### 3. Improved Error Logging (`services/a1zap-client.js`)

Added detailed logging for history API failures:
```javascript
console.error('   URL:', url);
console.error('   Status:', error.response?.status);
console.error('   Response Data:', error.response?.data);
```

This helps diagnose why the API is failing (rate limits, auth issues, etc.)

### 4. Default Prompt Fallback (`agents/makeup-artist-agent.js`)

When all else fails, apply a sensible default:
```javascript
"Apply a natural, flattering makeup look to this image. 
Include subtle enhancements like soft eye makeup, 
natural-looking foundation, and a touch of color on the lips."
```

This prevents Gemini from receiving empty prompts that result in text-only responses.

## Test Results

### Unit Tests: ✅ All Pass

```bash
node tests/test-conversation-cache.js
```

- ✅ Store and retrieve images
- ✅ Store and retrieve makeup requests
- ✅ Filter trivial requests
- ✅ Multiple images (get most recent)
- ✅ Full chat context
- ✅ Cache statistics
- ✅ Clear cache
- ✅ Chat isolation

### Image Context Tracking Tests: ✅ Pass

```bash
node tests/test-image-context-tracking.js
```

- ✅ Find recent image from history
- ✅ Extract previous makeup request
- ✅ Build prompt referencing previous style
- ✅ Process history with image URLs
- ✅ Handle "Yes" with context

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Sends Text Then Image

```
User: "Make my skin lighter and my brows sharper"
  └─ System caches request ✅
  └─ System responds conversationally

User: *sends image*
  └─ System caches image ✅
  └─ System tries to fetch history (fails ❌)
  └─ System falls back to cache ✅
  └─ Retrieves: "Make my skin lighter and my brows sharper"
  └─ Sends to Gemini with full context
  └─ Gemini generates edited image ✅
```

### Scenario 2: User Says "Apply it to this image too"

```
User: *sends image 1* with "Natural makeup"
  └─ System caches both ✅
  └─ Generates edited image ✅

User: *sends image 2* with "Apply it to this image too"
  └─ System detects reference phrase ✅
  └─ Retrieves previous request from cache
  └─ Applies same "Natural makeup" style ✅
```

### Scenario 3: User Confirms with "Yes"

```
User: "Blue lips and smokey eyes"
  └─ System caches request ✅
  
Bot: "Would you like me to proceed?"

User: "Yes"
  └─ System detects confirmation ✅
  └─ Retrieves most recent request from cache
  └─ Retrieves most recent image from cache
  └─ Applies "Blue lips and smokey eyes" ✅
```

## Files Modified

### Created
- `/services/conversation-cache.js` - In-memory cache for images and requests
- `/tests/test-conversation-cache.js` - Unit tests for cache
- `/tests/test-image-context-tracking.js` - Integration tests
- `/tests/test-history-media-field.js` - API diagnosis tool
- `/COMPLETE_IMAGE_CONTEXT_FIX.md` - This document

### Modified
- `/webhooks/makeup-artist-webhook.js` - Integrated cache, added fallback logic
- `/services/webhook-helpers.js` - Added image tracking in history processing
- `/agents/makeup-artist-agent.js` - Enhanced prompt building with defaults
- `/services/a1zap-client.js` - Improved error logging

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Restart the server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the flow
1. Send text: "Make my skin lighter and my brows sharper"
2. Send an image (without text)
3. **Expected**: Image is processed with the makeup from step 1 ✅

### 3. Monitor logs for:
```
💾 Cached image for chat...
💾 Cached makeup request...
💾 Using recent image from cache (history unavailable)
💄 Using previous request from cache (history unavailable)
```

## Cache Statistics Endpoint (Optional Enhancement)

You can add a debug endpoint to monitor cache health:

```javascript
// Add to server.js
app.get('/debug/cache-stats', (req, res) => {
  const stats = conversationCache.getCacheStats();
  res.json({
    ...stats,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- **~1KB per image** (just URL + metadata)
- **~500 bytes per request** (text + timestamp)
- **Worst case**: 100 active chats × (5 images + 10 requests) = ~50KB total
- **Auto-cleanup**: Expires after 30 minutes of inactivity

### Scalability
For production at scale:
1. Replace in-memory Map with Redis
2. Add proper session management
3. Implement distributed caching
4. Add metrics/monitoring

## Why This Fix Works

### Resilience
✅ **API goes down?** → Cache keeps working  
✅ **History unavailable?** → Cache has context  
✅ **Rate limited?** → Cache reduces API calls  

### User Experience
✅ **Natural conversations** → "Apply it here too" just works  
✅ **No repeated questions** → System remembers context  
✅ **Faster responses** → Cache is instant (no API latency)  

### Developer Experience
✅ **Easy debugging** → Clear logging of cache hits/misses  
✅ **Testable** → Unit tests verify behavior  
✅ **Maintainable** → Separation of concerns (cache service is isolated)  

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Cache is working** - Tested and verified
2. ⏭️ **Monitor production** - Watch logs for cache hits
3. ⏭️ **Fix history API** - Investigate why it returns 500 errors
4. ⏭️ **Add Redis** (if scaling beyond single server)
5. ⏭️ **Add metrics** - Track cache hit rate, API failure rate

## Success Metrics

Track these in production:
- **Cache hit rate**: % of times cache is used vs API
- **API failure rate**: % of history API calls that fail
- **Image generation success rate**: % of images successfully generated by Gemini
- **User satisfaction**: Fewer "What would you like?" responses

## Debugging

If issues persist:

### Check cache is working:
```bash
# In your code, add:
console.log('Cache stats:', conversationCache.getCacheStats());
```

### Check API health:
```bash
node tests/test-history-media-field.js <YOUR_CHAT_ID>
```

### Check Gemini prompts:
Look for log line: `Generated prompt for image editing:`
- Should NOT be empty
- Should include specific makeup requests

## Conclusion

The fix addresses all three root causes:

1. ❌ **History API failures** → ✅ Cache provides fallback
2. ❌ **Empty prompts** → ✅ Default prompts + cached context
3. ❌ **Lost context** → ✅ Cache retains recent images and requests

**Result**: Makeup artist agent now reliably processes images even when the history API fails.
