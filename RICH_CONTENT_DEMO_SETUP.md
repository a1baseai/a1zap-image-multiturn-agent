# Rich Content Demo Agent - Quick Setup Guide

## What Was Built

A **non-AI showcase agent** that demonstrates all 18 rich content types available in the A1Zap platform through simple text commands.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
RICH_CONTENT_DEMO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
RICH_CONTENT_DEMO_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id_here
```

### 2. Start Server

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Test It

Send a message to the agent:
- `carousel` â†’ See a product carousel
- `poll` â†’ See a voting poll
- `form` â†’ See a contact form
- `help` â†’ See all commands
- `all` â†’ See multiple examples

## What It Does

âœ… **First message**: Lists all 18 available commands  
âœ… **User types command**: Gets a filled example of that content type  
âœ… **No AI**: Instant responses with hardcoded examples  
âœ… **All 18 types**: Carousel, gallery, buttons, polls, forms, cards, etc.

## Example Commands
