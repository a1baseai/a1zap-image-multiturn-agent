# Fix Summary: Makeup Artist Context Handling

## Problem Identified

The makeup artist agent was generating images without considering the conversation history. When users would:

1. Request a makeup style (e.g., "Can you give me full glam")
2. Confirm their choice
3. Upload an image

The agent would ignore the "full glam" request and generate a generic image because it only looked at the current message (which was empty when just uploading an image).

## Solution Implemented

### Core Changes

**File: `agents/makeup-artist-agent.js`**
- Enhanced `buildPrompt()` to accept and analyze conversation history
- Extracts makeup-related keywords from the last 6 messages
- Keywords include: makeup, lipstick, eye, glam, natural, dramatic, contour, highlight, blush, foundation
- Chains multiple requests together with " → " separator
- Uses context when current message is empty or minimal (≤3 characters)

**File: `webhooks/makeup-artist-webhook.js`**
- Updated to pass conversation history to `buildPrompt()`
- Added logging to show the generated prompts for debugging

### How It Works

**Example conversation flow:**

```
User: "Can you give me full glam"
Agent: [responds with description]

User: "yep"  
Agent: [confirms]

User: [uploads image with no text]
Agent: [generates image with FULL GLAM applied! ✨]
```

**The generated prompt now includes:**
```
Previous request context: Can you give me full glam

Apply the makeup changes described in the previous conversation 
to this new image. Keep your text response brief and friendly - 
describe what you've done in 1-2 sentences.
```

## Testing

### Test Files Created

1. **`tests/test-makeup-context.js`** - Full integration test
   - Tests the complete multi-turn conversation flow
   - Simulates: text request → confirmation → image upload
   - Verifies image is generated with proper context

2. **`tests/test-prompt-building.js`** - Unit test for prompt building
   - Demonstrates 4 scenarios with visual output
   - Shows how context is extracted and used
   - Tests edge cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test prompt building logic (no server needed)
node tests/test-prompt-building.js

# Test full integration (requires server)
npm start &
sleep 5
node tests/test-makeup-context.js
```

### Test Results

✅ All tests pass  
✅ Context properly extracted from conversation  
✅ Prompts include previous makeup requests  
✅ Images generated with correct style applied  

## Benefits

1. **Natural Conversations** - Users can discuss what they want before uploading
2. **Better Accuracy** - Generated images match user requests
3. **Iterative Refinement** - Users can refine their requests across messages
4. **Flexible Workflow** - Works with various interaction patterns:
   - Image + text
   - Text → image  
   - Text → text → image
   - Image → text → image

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully backward compatible  
- First messages still work as before
- Direct image uploads with text still work
- No changes needed to existing deployments

## Documentation

- **`MAKEUP_CONTEXT_FIX.md`** - Detailed technical documentation
- **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** - Quick overview of changes
- **`FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - This document

## Next Steps

To deploy this fix:

1. Pull the latest code
2. Restart your server
3. Test with the conversation flow:
   - Say: "Can you give me full glam"
   - Say: "yep"  
   - Upload an image
   - Verify the image has full glam makeup applied

That's it! The fix automatically improves the user experience without any configuration changes needed.
